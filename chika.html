            WatersZZZZ
            (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars); Klose quit in 1965. Under
            Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the

        <p id="start"> Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist
            and
            thematic
            leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon
            (1973),
            Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink
            Floyd –
            The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards.

        <p>They had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that
            touched
            on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists. David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The
            Edge
            of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to "Dogs" from Animals.[375]
            Other
            bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen, Radiohead, Steven Wilson, Marillion,
            Queensrÿche,
            Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins.[376] Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive
            rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s.[377] The English rock band Mostly Autumn "fuse the music of
            Genesis
            and Pink Floyd" in their sound.
